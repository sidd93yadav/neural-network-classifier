# neural-network-classifier
This project is a NumPy-only implementation of a feedforward neural network designed to classify synthetic 5×6 pixel binary images of the characters A, B, and C. It includes custom weight initialization, sigmoid and softmax activation functions, manual forward and backward propagation, cross-entropy loss computation, and gradient descent updates. The dataset comprises 300 training samples created by introducing noise to three base patterns, each representing a letter. During training, loss and accuracy are tracked across epochs and visualized using matplotlib. The trained model predicts letter classes and displays corresponding images using imshow(), giving hands-on experience with matrix operations, data shaping, and neural network logic — all without using external ML libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch
